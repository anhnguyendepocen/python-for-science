This is a very extensive curriculum and should comprise up to 10 weeks of rigorous introductory Python.

Topics cover important, foundational skills for data mining, science, and research with Python including: 
 - data structures, control structures, data types
 - matplotlib (graphing and basic visualization)
 - pandas (data handling, cleaning, statistics)
 - numpy (numerical computation/calculus, linear algebra, etc.)
 
It is assumed that anyone using these materials has a very strong understanding of algebra and is familiar with basic concepts in statistics and calculus.
