To whom it concerns, this gives the shape and purpose of this repository.

In each lesson folder one or more files can be found. Each iPython notebook contains course material and work completed by the student. The problems and challenges for each lesson have been worked and then revised. There may be other files, such as images and spreadsheets which are used in the notebooks. These can ignored.

To give an accurate scope of the work done by the student, all of the code examples *were provided by the instructors, but most have been significantly modified and explored line-by-line by the student*. The problems were completed by the student, obviously.  The student also made their own edits, adjustments, and additions to the provided content, including some image and spreadsheet files.

All data containing sports statistics, real estate data, and census data were provided by the instructors. The student provided faux-data regarding US cities.

The student's edits and explorations contain references to fictional characters/events (comic books etc), famous mathematicians, MnM_17-18 staff/classmates, the student's own name, his dog Bam Bam, and other stuff that the student is interested in such as tasty beverages. This should show, in part, the degree to which the student engaged with and customized the provided content and material. 

Problems completed by the student have been recompiled and revised in the 'Problem' Notebooks, while all original attempts, notes, and lesson materials are found in the 'Lecture' Notebooks.

The 'Other' folder contains other snippets of tangential explorations that took place by the student, but nothing substantial.
